# D3-Challenge

Created D3 Visualization with transitions on X-axis (with Poverty, Age & Household Income) and Y-axis (with Healthcare, Smokers and Obese) showcasing the corresponding values of selected axes across all the US states in the form of bubble chart. 

### The following are the inisghts observed from the visualizations:

1. The Poverty vs. Healthcare visualization below shows that there is a direct relation between Poverty and Lacks in Healthcare such that the more the "In Poverty (%)" in the state the more is the "Lacks in Healthcare (%)".

2. Similarly, there is an inverse relation between Household Income and Lacks in Healthcare such that the more is the Household Income, the lesser is the lack in Healthcare (%).

3. Most of the states that have people who smokes are between the median age of 35 to 40 years, West Virginia being the state with highest % of smokers i.e. 27% with 41 years meadian age of people.

4. The Obese (%) vs. Household Income visualization shows that the lower the household income, the higher the Obese(%) in the state.
